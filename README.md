# TwitterBot-Using-Python-and-Selenium-

Here we have built a Twitter Bot that automatically logs in to your twitter account and searches for a particular hashtag , loads up the 
feeds related to that hashtag and likes them . Basically we do this using selenium framework in python. We also require gecko driver that loads up the mozilla browser on running the program.

We have installed gecko driver (so whenever we run our python script/app this gecko driver is going to open a firefox browser .Selenium requires a web driver to interface with the chosen browser. Web drivers is a package to interact with web browser. It interacts with the
web browser or a remote web server through a wire protocol which is common to all. You can check out and install the web drivers of your browser choice.
