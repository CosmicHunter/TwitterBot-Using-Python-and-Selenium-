# TwitterBot-Using-Python-and-Selenium-

Here we have built a Twitter Bot that automatically logs in to your twitter account and searches for a particular hashtag , loads up the 
feeds related to that hashtag and likes them . Basically we do this using selenium framework in python. We also require gecko driver that loads up the mozilla browser on running the program.
